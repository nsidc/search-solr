## Unreleased

  - Use latest version of `search-solr-tools` gem when building VM.
  - Modify CI job configuration for deploying `search-solr-tools` to simply do a
    `bundle install`.
  - Modify CI job configuration to use `bundle exec` when executing
    `search-solr-tools`.
  - Attempt to update Solr configuration files in a way that incorporates
    existing NSIDC configuration (unless the configuration causes Solr ingest
    errors) with new Solr defaults. Remove Solr defaults that appear to be
    irrelevant to NSIDC's needs.
  - Update Ruby version in Gemfile (originally intended this change to be part of the SRCH-15 work).

## v3.0.0 (2019-07-02)

  - Use default configuration for solr.xml and to initialize directories for configured cores.
  - Use managed schema instead of classic schema for configured cores.
  - Use built-in deployment script to set up Solr.
  - Install `search_solr_tools` via `Gemfile`.
  - Update Vagrant and Puppet plugins as needed to support latest Solr installation.
