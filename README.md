# nsidc-search-solr

This vagrant project stands up a Solr instance for NSIDC Search / Arctic Data
Explorer.

See
[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/nsidc/search-solr/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
for information on past versions.

# Requirements and Setup at NSIDC

## Requirements
For use at NSIDC, this project requires the [vagrant-nsidc-plugin](https://bitbucket.org/nsidc/vagrant-nsidc-plugin).

Dependencies are defined in the CI configuration and should be available upon machine provision.

Note that the `search-solr-tools` gem is **not** installed via Bundler.
See the entries matching the strings `deploy_solr_tools_command` and
`Deploy_solr-search-tools-gem` in `puppet/ci.yaml`.

## Setup
The virtual machine will be provisioned using the
[puppet-nsidc-solr](https://bitbucket.org/nsidc/puppet-nsidc-solr) module.
NSIDC Search / Arctic Data Explorer configurations will be applied once Solr is
installed.

To provision the machine:
```shell
vagrant nsidc up --env=dev
```

Once provisioning is complete, the Solr dashboard is accessible from
[http://&lt;environment&gt;.search-solr.apps.int.nsidc.org:8983/solr](), where
&lt;environment&gt; is one of dev, integration, qa, etc.

Additionally if the VM is brought up via the CI jenkins job (as defined in ci.yaml)
[search-solr-tools](https://github.com/nsidc/search-solr-tools) will be deployed
 and available on the newly-provisioned machine.

# Requirements and Setup for Non-NSIDC users

## Requirements

When using the project outside of the NSIDC environment, the configuration that
would normally be managed by Puppet will not be applied, and Solr will not be
installed.  You will have to manuall set up an environment with an installed instance of
[Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/downloads.html) and its dependencies.
(`puppet-nsidc-solr` currently installs Solr version 8.1.1.)

## Setup

These steps mirror the actions managed by the `puppet-nsidc-solr` module and this project's
`puppet/site.pp` manifest.

* Download the SOLR source and unpack it:

```
  tar -xvzf solr-4.3.0.tgz
```

*  Copy the 'collection1' core directory to add all the defaults/create the `nsidc_oai` and `auto_suggest` cores:

```
cd ${solr_path}/example/solr`
cp -Rp collection1 nsidc_oai
cp -Rp collection1 auto_suggest
rm -Rf collection1
```

* Copy the following files from this repo to the listed target directories to configure SOLR:

```
config/solr.xml -> ${solr_path}/example/solr/solr.xml
config/solrconfig.nsidc_oai.xml ->  ${solr_path}/example/solr/nsidc_oai/conf/solrconfig.xml
config/solrconfig.autosuggest.xml -> ${solr_path}/example/solr/auto_suggest/conf/solrconfig.xml
config/schema.xml -> ${solr_path}/example/solr/nsidc_oai/conf/schema.xml
config/schema.autosuggest.xml -> ${solr_path}/example/solr/auto_suggest/conf/schema.xml
```

* Start SOLR:

```
cd ${solr_path}/example
java -jar start.jar
```

Please note that this should serve only as an example of how to configure solr
utilizing our configuration with the example from the solr distribution.  Before
utilizing this example in a non-experimental setting you should consider
utilizing a proper webserver (e.g. jetty) and configuring the location/cores/etc
as applies to your particular environment.
